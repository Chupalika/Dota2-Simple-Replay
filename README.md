# Dota 2 Simple Replay
A visualization tool to view simplified Dota 2 replays. Developed using [clarity-examples](https://github.com/skadistats/clarity-examples). This project was developed for a class project, so don't expect too much. :)

# Changelog
* [**2018-04-19**] Initial commit. All we have is a minimap background with 10 colored circles, one for each hero, overlayed to indicate player positions. A slider at the top lets the user control time.
